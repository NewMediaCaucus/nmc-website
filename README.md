# nmc-website
 
## Workflow Proposal

Kirby relies on four main folders: kirby, media, site, and content. In order to keep our repo from getting too big, we'll use .gitignore to exclude the media and content folders (with one or two individual file exceptions). 

The dev team should install:
- Github Desktop
- A coding IDE (win: Visual Studio Code)
- Local Apache server (win: xampp)
- FTP (win: winscp)

Set up local repository:
- Clone the nmc-website repo at C://xampp/htdocs (win)
- Changes focus on site operation and style, not content
- All changes should have detailed notes

Nick and Rob will put some options here about automatically backing up the media and content folders
