## Important File Locations

- Content
  - style.css
  - site.txt
- Kirby
  - Leave this alone unless updating the Kirby CMS
- Media
  - Leave this alone too, contents are auto-generated
- Site
   - Blueprints
     - Controls how the panel operates
   - Snippets
     - PHP code snippets
   - Templates
     - PHP page templates 
 
## Workflow Proposal

Kirby relies on four main folders: kirby, media, site, and content. In order to keep our repo from getting too big, we'll use .gitignore to exclude the media and content folders (with one or two individual file exceptions). 

The dev team should install:
- Github Desktop
- Coding IDE (win: Visual Studio Code)
- Local Apache server (win: xampp)
- FTP (win: winscp)

Set up local repository:
- Clone the nmc-website repo at C://xampp/htdocs (win)
- Changes focus on site operation and style, not content
- All changes should have detailed notes

Still needed: solution to back up content and media folders.
